# ormuco_test

For this test I'm using python 3.6.

For the "Overlapper" I made it work like a program. So It can be started from command line interface.
It takes the input directly from terminal.

For the "Version checker" I tried to make it look more like an external library ( module ) that someone
can import in his code and use.
